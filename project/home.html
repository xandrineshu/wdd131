                <h2>What is Music?</h2>
                <p>
                    Music is an artistic expression that employs sound and silence,
                    structured over time, to produce rhythm, melody, harmony, and other
                    expressive features. It's a global human activity found in every culture,
                    utilized to convey feelings, thoughts, and experiences. Music can be vocal,
                    instrumental, or a mix of both, and it can be made impulsively or
                    meticulously arranged. It serves various purposes, from entertainment and
                    relaxation to cultural rituals and social bonding.

                <h2>Music Genres</h2>
                <p>
                    Music genres are categories that identify pieces of music as
                    belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.
                    Genres may be defined by a variety of factors, including musical
                    techniques, styles, cultural context, and content.
                    Here are some popular music genres:

                <h3>Pop Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Pop music, which is short for popular music, is a genre that is popular and catchy.
                    It frequently has danceable rhythms and melodies that are easy to remember.
                    Its definition is a little ambiguous because it is a dynamic genre that constantly
                    changes and incorporates elements of other musical styles.
                    Pop music is basically defined as music that is widely listened to and
                    disseminated via mainstream media.

                <h3>Rock Music</h3>
                <p>
                    A powerful beat and the use of electric guitars, bass, and drums
                    are characteristics of the popular music genre known as rock.
                    It first appeared in the United States in the 1950s, developing
                    from rock and roll, which combined elements of country, blues, and
                    rhythm and blues. There are many different subgenres and styles of
                    rock music, each with distinctive qualities of its own.

                <h3>Hip-Hop Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Rapping and a powerful, rhythmic beat are the most common characteristics
                    of hip-hop music, which started in the 1970s in the African American and
                    Latino communities of New York City. Breakdancing, graffiti art,
                    DJing (turntablism), and emceeing (rapping) are the four main components
                    of this culture, which is more than just music. With a wide range of
                    subgenres and influences, hip-hop has become a worldwide phenomenon.

                <h3>Country Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Western cowboy music and southern folk music are the origins of the popular
                    American music genre known as country music. It usually has narrative lyrics
                    and straightforward vocal melodies backed by stringed instruments like guitar,
                    banjo, and violin. The genre first appeared in the early 1900s and
                    has since developed into a number of subgenres and styles.

                <h3>R&B/Soul Music</h3>
                <p>
                    R&B, short for Rhythm and Blues, and Soul music are distinct but
                    related genres of African American music with overlapping
                    roots and influences. R&B emerged in the 1940s, evolving from blues,
                    jazz, and gospel, and is characterized by its strong backbeat, catchy
                    melodies, and focus on themes of love and relationships.
                    Soul music, which developed later, is a more emotionally expressive
                    genre that often incorporates gospel influences and emphasizes
                    themes of identity, struggle, and social justice.

                <p>
                    Electronic Dance Music, or EDM, is a general term that includes
                    a variety of dance-oriented electronic music subgenres that
                    are frequently heard at festivals, nightclubs, and raves.
                    Usually, it is made so that DJs can mix it smoothly and 
                    provide dancers with a constant stream of music.
                    EDM is distinguished by its electronic sounds, powerful danceable
                    beats, and emphasis on fostering a dancing atmosphere,
                    even though it encompasses a wide variety of subgenres.

                <h3>Classical Music</h3>
                <p>
                    The term "classical music" generally refers to Western art music,
                    which is distinguished by its formality, intricacy, and
                    historical significance. Although it covers a broad spectrum of
                    styles and time periods, from the Middle Ages to the 20th century,
                    it is most closely linked to the Classical era, which roughly spanned
                    1750-1830. Different from folk or popular music traditions, classical
                    music is frequently regarded as having aesthetic merit and enduring value.

                <h3>Jazz Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Syncopated rhythms, improvisation, and a distinctive fusion of African-American
                    and European musical traditions are characteristics of Jazz music.

                    is renowned for its expressive freedom and intricate harmony.
                    Blue notes, swing rhythms, and call-and-response patterns are frequently heard in it.

                <h3>Reggae Music</h3>
                <p>
                    The late 1960s saw the emergence of the Jamaican music style known as Reggae.
                    It is renowned for its unique bass lines and frequently socially conscious lyrics,
                    and it is distinguished by a powerful, syncopated rhythm that frequently
                    emphasizes the offbeat. The spiritual and political themes of the Rastafarian
                    movement are closely linked to reggae.
