                <h2>‧₊˚♪ What is Music? 𝄞₊˚⊹</h2>
                <p>
                    The arrangement of sounds to produce a particular form, harmony,
                    melody, rhythm, or other expressive content is called Music.
                    It is widely acknowledged that all human societies have music as
                    a cultural element. The content and methodology of definitions of
                    music differ greatly. Although academics concur that a limited number
                    of distinct elements define music, they cannot agree on what these
                    essential components are. Many people describe music as a very flexible
                    medium for expressing human creativity. Music is created through a
                    variety of processes, which are frequently categorized as performance,
                    improvisation, and composition. The human voice is one of the many musical
                    instruments that can be used to perform music.

                            Pop music, which is short for popular music, is a genre that is popular and catchy.
                            It frequently has danceable rhythms and melodies that are easy to remember.
                            Its definition is a little ambiguous because it is a dynamic genre that constantly
                            changes and incorporates elements of other musical styles.
                            Pop music is basically defined as music that is widely listened to and
                            disseminated via mainstream media.

                            A powerful beat and the use of electric guitars, bass, and drums
                            are characteristics of the popular music genre known as rock.
                            It first appeared in the US in the 1950s, developing
                            from rock and roll, which combined elements of country, blues, and
                            rhythm and blues. There are many different subgenres and styles of
                            rock music, each with distinctive qualities of its own.

                            Rapping and a powerful, rhythmic beat are the most common characteristics
                            of hip-hop music, which started in the 1970s in the African American and
                            Latino communities of New York City. Breakdancing, graffiti art,
                            DJing (turntablism), and emceeing (rapping) are the four main components
                            of this culture, which is more than just music.

                            Western cowboy music and southern folk music are the origins of the popular
                            American music genre known as country music. It usually has narrative lyrics
                            and straightforward vocal melodies backed by stringed instruments like guitar,
                            banjo, and violin. The genre first appeared in the early 1900s and
                            has since developed into a number of subgenres and styles.

                            Rhythm and blues, or R&B, is a popular music style that began in the 1940s
                            in African American communities in the United States. It combines aspects of gospel,
                            jazz, and blues music. R&B frequently includes themes of love, relationships,
                            and social issues and is renowned for its powerful rhythmic pulse and soulful vocals.

                            The term "classical music" generally refers to Western art music,
                            which is distinguished by its formality, intricacy, and historical
                            significance. Although it covers a broad spectrum of styles and time
                            periods, from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, it is most closely
                            linked to the Classical era, which roughly spanned 1750-1830.

                            and European musical traditions are characteristics of Jazz music. Jazz, which
                            originated in New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
                            is renowned for its expressive freedom and intricate harmony.

                            The late 1960s saw the emergence of the Jamaican music style known as Reggae.
                            It is renowned for its unique bass lines and frequently socially conscious lyrics,
                            and it is distinguished by a powerful, syncopated rhythm that frequently
                            emphasizes the offbeat. The spiritual and political themes of the Rastafarian
                            movement are closely linked to reggae.
