    <h1> Welcome to Week 01, dear user! </h1>

    <h2> This is a test of the publishing workflow.

        <p>
            It is a simple HTML file that will be used to test the publishing process.
            The goal is to ensure that the file is correctly uploaded and displayed on the web server.
            Please check the output to confirm that everything is working as expected.
            
            <p1>
            If you see this message, it means the file has been successfully published!
            Hooray! ðŸŽ‰
