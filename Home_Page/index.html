            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p1>
                My name is Jelina Alexandrine but you can call me Alex.
                I am born in the Philippines and was raised in France,
                which makes me speak French, English, and Tagalog fluently.
                I currently live in the Philippines and just returned from
                my mission in the Philippines San Pablo Mission. I am now a student
                at Brigham Young University - Idaho, studying Web Design and Development.
                I love to design, which made me choose this course.
                My hobbies include drawing, and binge-watching anime and k-dramas.

            <h3>Bulacan, Philippines</h3>
            <p2>
                Bulacan is a province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region.
                It is known for its rich history, culture, and natural beauty.
                The province is famous for its historical sites, such as the Barasoain Church,
                which played a significant role in Philippine history, and the Malolos Cathedral.
                Bulacan is also known for its traditional crafts, such as pottery and weaving,
                as well as its delicious local cuisine, including dishes like longganisa (sausage) and
                pastillas de leche (milk candy). I hope you can visit this wonderful place someday!
